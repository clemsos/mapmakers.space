Here goes a short paragraph of introduction about the production of space[^Lefebvre1991] urbanity, including references from third spaces[^Bhabha1994] [^Soja1996] and critical geography.



##### Creative spaces in our cities

Since its formulation 25 years ago, the hypothesis of the creative city[^Florida2002] still remains an important cornerstone of urban design and policies. In a paper called *The Anatomy of the Creative City*, Cohendet et al[^Cohendet2012] identify three layers in this creative city : the *upperground* which represent the formal institutions (firms, companies, public services, etc), the *underground* where resides creative, artistic and cultural activities without formal production, exploitation or diffusion and more interestingly the *middleground* which constitues *"a critical intermediate structure linking the underground to the upperground"* (ibid).

This idea of the presence of *middleground* structures within the city has been partly embodied by the concept of *third places*[^Oldenburg1999], which represents social setups between home and office (cafes, libraries, events, etc). Recently, a new type of spaces has appeared in many cities under the names of fablabs, makerspaces, hackerspaces, incubators, coworking spaces, etc.


##### The study of networks and assemblages

What are they? How can they be defined? How can we learn more about them? While they first exist as urban places, they also appear to be embedded in larger spatial and social networks of similar spaces and sometimes diverging interests. While we can  consider these places as part of a larger urban assemblage [^McFarlane2011] [^FariasBender2012], we still need proper ways to approach the specificities of these complex objects .

How can we observe them? How can we collect, record, map, visualize and analyze information about these spaces? What are the existing techniques? Traditional approaches in social and human sciences (ethnography, statistics, interviews, discourse analysis, etc.) provide little guidance about the specific ways to lead studies about such fragmented and discontinued objects.

#### Prototyping mixed and hybrid methods

The present workshop aims at bringing together practitioners from different disciplines and background to design new methods, processes, protocols or tools that can support the study of such open-ended objects.

Some of these different methods may include : ethnographic field work (interviews, note-taking, sketching, etc), data-based analysis (text mining, online social network mapping, etc ), experimental design (fast prototyping, user testing, etc), sensible approaches of urbanity (soundscapes, exploratory walks, etc), ...

Here are some open questions we plan to discus during the workshop :

**HOW TO**

- Constitute a documentation of activities in a makerspace?
- Use websites and social networks as sources?
- Integrate interviews and field notes with findings from data-based analysis?
- Organize multiple media produced during field work (sounds, pictures, etc.)?
- Lead and record interviews based on third activity (drawings, etc.)  ?
- Record and structure networks of relationships between actors?
- Visualize and annotate maps properly to produce new representations?
- ...
