**Abstract**
This introductory paper questions how urban places emerging from the maker movement are re-assembling spatial settings in cities, with the example of the Shenzhen/Hong-Kong area. We discuss how the growing importance of assemblage in manufacturing processes may produce new urban forms, while possibly leading to standardized and risky technocratic projects.
