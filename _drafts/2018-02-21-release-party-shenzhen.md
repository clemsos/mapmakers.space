**Date**: Saturday March 10th 2018  
**Time**: Workshop : 2pm-5pm / 5:30-7pm : talks

During the last decades, Chinese cities have seen the apparition of new industrial spaces that have transformed radically the ways technologies are produced. More recently, stakeholders of a growing “maker movement“ have become gradually interested by this gigantic production infrastructure, while governmental policies started promoting technological innovation as the new engine of national economy and global outreach.

*Mapping Spaces for Making* is a research initiative that aims at documenting the encounters between multiple dynamics around the production of technologies in China during the last decade. This workshop will introduce early results of the project, and the outcomes of a 10-days fieldwork and writing session in Shanghai and Shenzhen.

We will release an early version of the book [*Mapping Spaces for Making*](http://zine.mapmakers.space).

#### WORKSHOP (2-5pm) : From Web to Book · Bookbinding maps and digital content

Our team will present and explain the experimental process of 1) producing maps and visualizations during fieldwork and 2) bring local and remote contributors to write together about spaces for making in China. We will introduce the **fieldwork and writing strategies** that has been developed as well as our  **web-to-print workflow** to turning results into a printed book.

Attendees will learn about bookbinding technics by making their own printed issue of the book. We will also offer short introductions to basic electronics and soldering - all ages : kids and adults welcome!


##### This book is open to contributions. If you are interested, please check the [writing guidelines](http://zine.mapmakers.space).

#### RESTITUTION (5:30pm) : Mapping Spaces for Making
###### by Clément Renaud, Monique Bolli, Florence Graezer-Bideau & Marc Laperouzza  · Institute for Area and Global Studies, EPFL

From February 28th to March 10th 2018, we have been hosting a [fieldwork session](/2018/01/call-workshop/) in the cities of Shanghai and Shenzhen. Ethnographers, designers, makers, geographers, architects, policy-makers, media archeologists, and artists came together on and offline to recollect the unique story of making technology in China. We will resitute what have been done during the 10 days and present the **early outcomes of this ongoing research initiative**.

#### BOOK LAUNCH (6:00pm) : The Field Guide to Hacking · by Michelle Poon · Dim Sum Labs Hackerspace (Hong Kong)

We will have the pleasure to host Michelle Poon from Dim Sum Labs hackerspace in Hong Kong that will present her new book *The Field Guide to Hacking*.

> Today, many everyday citizens remain in a world of quasi-magic where they believe only a special-class of techno-wizards (engineers, etc.) really understand what is going on. As a hackerspace, Dim Sum Labs strive to open up those black boxes and reveal the hidden mechanisms with their opportunities and dangers. The goal is to empower users through knowledge and provide them with the tools to take true control and ownership over their digital helpers. Thus, the intent of this book—to shrug off the misnomer and offer a handshake to the greater community—it is only reasonable to encourage others to hack, by showing you how.

Michelle Poon works in the field of architecture, art and research by combining engineering and interaction/user experience design towards immersive environments. The investigations are to examine patterns in perceptual mechanisms and social identities emerging in points-of-tensions: the physical and virtual, and the technical and abstract.

**The day will end with drinks and snacks.**
