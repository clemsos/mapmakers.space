前几十年，新的制造空间出现在中国的城市里，又改变了怎么创造技术。最近，国际的“创客”对中国的新制造流程和基础建設越来越感兴趣。同时，北京政府也把创新成为主要的本体和国际开发渠道。

”创客城市”是关一个瑞士罗撒理工大学的研究项目于在中国这十年的動力邂逅和变化。这个工作放会介绍早期的研究结果额过程，包括在上海和深圳前十天的检查。

我们会发布[”创客城市”小册子](http://zine.mapmakers.space)的第一个版本。来自香港DSL创客空间的Michelle Poon会介绍她的新书 *The Field Guide to Hacking*.

#### 工作坊 (下午2到5点) : 把网络和地图裝訂成冊

我们团队会解释具体的实验研究方式，包括话地图和可视化图，还有怎么把跟本体和网友一起去写和出版一本实体的书。

参加者会学一些裝訂书的技术，还有基础的焊接技术用小电子版 —— 欢迎大人和孩子：）

**Date**: Saturday March 10th 2018  
**Time**: Workshop : 2pm-5pm / 5:30-7pm : talks  
**Language**: English+Chinese  
**Place**: [Shenzhen Design Center](http://www.szdesigncenter.org), Shangmeilin, Zhongkang Road 8, Futian district, Shenzhen —— 上梅林中康路8号雕塑院圆筒


During the last decades, Chinese cities have seen the apparition of new industrial spaces that have transformed radically the ways technologies are produced. More recently, stakeholders of a growing “maker movement“ have become gradually interested by this gigantic production infrastructure, while governmental policies started promoting technological innovation as the new engine of national economy and global outreach.

*Mapping Spaces for Making* is a research initiative that aims at documenting the encounters between multiple dynamics around the production of technologies in China during the last decade. This workshop will introduce early results of the project, and the outcomes of a 10-days fieldwork and writing session in Shanghai and Shenzhen.

We will release an early version of the book [*Mapping Spaces for Making*](http://zine.mapmakers.space). We will also have thev pleasure to host Michelle Poon from Dim Sum Labs hackerspace in Hong Kong to introduce her new book *The Field Guide to Hacking*.

#### WORKSHOP (2-5pm) : From Web to Book · Bookbinding maps and digital content

Our team will present and explain the experimental process of 1) producing maps and visualizations during fieldwork and 2) bring local and remote contributors to write together about spaces for making in China. We will introduce the **fieldwork and writing strategies** that has been developed as well as our **web-to-print workflow** to turning results into a printed book.

Attendees will learn about bookbinding technics by making their own printed issue of the book. We will also offer short introductions to basic electronics and soldering - all ages : kids and adults welcome!


##### This book is open to contributions. If you are interested, please check the [writing guidelines](http://zine.mapmakers.space).

#### RESTITUTION (5:30pm) : Mapping Spaces for Making
###### by Clément Renaud, Monique Bolli, Florence Graezer-Bideau & Marc Laperouzza  · Institute for Area and Global Studies, EPFL

From February 28th to March 10th 2018, we have been hosting a [fieldwork session](/2018/01/call-workshop/) in the cities of Shanghai and Shenzhen. Ethnographers, designers, makers, geographers, architects, policy-makers, media archeologists, and artists came together on and offline to recollect the unique story of making technology in China. We will resitute what have been done during the 10 days and present the **early outcomes of this ongoing research initiative**.

#### BOOK LAUNCH (6:00pm) : The Field Guide to Hacking · by Michelle Poon · Dim Sum Labs Hackerspace (Hong Kong)

Michelle Poon from [Dim Sum Labs hackerspace](https://www.dimsumlabs.com/) in Hong Kong will present her new book *The Field Guide to Hacking*.

> Today, many everyday citizens remain in a world of quasi-magic where they believe only a special-class of techno-wizards (engineers, etc.) really understand what is going on. As a hackerspace, Dim Sum Labs strive to open up those black boxes and reveal the hidden mechanisms with their opportunities and dangers. The goal is to empower users through knowledge and provide them with the tools to take true control and ownership over their digital helpers. Thus, the intent of this book—to shrug off the misnomer and offer a handshake to the greater community—it is only reasonable to encourage others to hack, by showing you how.

![](/uploads/workshop-shenzhen/cover.jpg)![](/uploads/workshop-shenzhen/michelle.png)

Michelle Poon works in the field of architecture, art and research by combining engineering and interaction/user experience design towards immersive environments. The investigations are to examine patterns in perceptual mechanisms and social identities emerging in points-of-tensions: the physical and virtual, and the technical and abstract.

**The day will end with drinks and snacks.**
