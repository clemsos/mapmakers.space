The workshop will introduce the outcomes of 10 days of fieldwork in Shanghai and Shenzhen by releasing an early version of the *Mapping Spaces for Making* book.

Our team will present and explain the experimental process of bringing local and remote contributors to write together about spaces for making in China, and turning the results into a printed book. We will introduce the **web-to-print workflow**, as well as **writing strategies** that has been developed.

After this introduction, attendees will learn to bind book using technics inspired by traditional Chinese bookbinding. They will make their own printed issues of the book.

#### RESTITUTION (5:30pm) : Mapping Spaces for Making
###### by Clément Renaud, Monique Bolli, Florence Graezer-Bideau & Marc Laperouzza  · Institute for Area and Global Studies, EPFL

During the last ten years, Chinese cities have been the place for various initiatives and encounters trying to transform how technologies are made. Stakeholders of a growing “maker movement“ have become gradually interested by China’s gigantic industrial infrastructure, while governmental policies started promoting technological innovation as the new engine of national economy and global expansion towards Asia and Africa.

From February 28th to March 10th 2018, we have been hosting a workshop called [MAPPING SPACES FOR MAKING](/2018/01/call-workshop/) in the cities of Shanghai and Shenzhen to re-collect how these ongoing transformations have been unfolding. Ethnographers, makers, policy-makers, media archeologists, designers, architects, geographers and artists used their knowledge and tools to create a unique book from the unique story of making in China.

We will resitute what have been done during the 10 days and present workflow, tools and outcomes of the workshop.

#### BOOK LAUNCH (6:00pm) : The Field Guide to Hacking · by Michelle Poon · Dim Sum Labs Hackerspace (Hong Kong)

Today, many everyday citizens remain in a world of quasi-magic where they believe only a special-class of techno-wizards (engineers, etc.) really understand what is going on. As a hackerspace, Dim Sum Labs strive to open up those black boxes and reveal the hidden mechanisms with their opportunities and dangers. The goal is to empower users through knowledge and provide them with the tools to take true control and ownership over their digital helpers. Thus, the intent of this book—to shrug off the misnomer and offer a handshake to the greater community—it is only reasonable to encourage others to hack, by showing you how.

Michelle Poon works in the field of architecture, art and research by combining engineering and interaction/user experience design towards immersive environments. The investigations are to examine patterns in perceptual mechanisms and social identities emerging in points-of-tensions: the physical and virtual, and the technical and abstract.
