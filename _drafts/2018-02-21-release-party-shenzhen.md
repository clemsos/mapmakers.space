#### Mapping Spaces for Making : Early Findings · by Clément Renaud (France) · EPFL

Presentation of the project

#### BOOK LAUNCH : The Field Guide to Hacking · by Michelle Poon (Hong Kong) · Dim Sum Labs Hackerspace

Today, many everyday citizens remain in a world of quasi-magic where they believe only a special-class of techno-wizards (engineers, etc.) really understand what is going on. As a hackerspace, Dim Sum Labs strive to open up those black boxes and reveal the hidden mechanisms with their opportunities and dangers. The goal is to empower users through knowledge and provide them with the tools to take true control and ownership over their digital helpers. Thus, the intent of this book—to shrug off the misnomer and offer a handshake to the greater community—it is only reasonable to encourage others to hack, by showing you how.

Michelle Poon works in the field of architecture, art and research by combining engineering and interaction/user experience design towards immersive environments. The investigations are to examine patterns in perceptual mechanisms and social identities emerging in points-of-tensions: the physical and virtual, and the technical and abstract.
