Ten days of intense fieldwork, visits and interviews of the MapMakers project ended with the production of a small booklet during the final event in Shenzhen. The following article gives a brief overview of how this research trip unfolded and some of the early takeaways.

## The fieldwork

During the *Mapping Spaces for Making* workshop, we wanted to re-collect how different spaces that have been instrumental in the storytelling of makers in Shanghai and Shenzhen have been transforming over the years. During 10 days, a research team of 4 to 6 people have been collecting pictures, drawings, maps, data and recordings during visits into these different spaces.

The research team was made of :

- Clément Renaud, geographer and computer scientists from EPFL
- Monique Bolli, phD student in social anthropology
- Anais Bloch, product designer and researcher at HEAD Geneva
- Emanuele Protti, architect at Polytechnico Torino
- Florence Graezer-Bideau, anthropologist at EPFL
- Marc Laperouzza, economist at EPFL


We spent 5 days in each city : 4 days of investigation and 1 day dedicated to public restitution. Altogether, we visited a dozen of spaces from the smallest fablab to larger electronic retail cluster. The information we collected will be subject to publication under different forms (online blogging, scientific articles, book, etc). For now, we will take the time during the following months to process all this data.


## Making the prototype of a book

"Learning-by-doing" is one of the foundational pillar of discourses and practices in maker communities. Indeed, what better learning process than doing things yourself? Tim Ingold in his book *Making* show the importance of experiencing the gestures to understand better how things are made.

*Object map by Laurent, living and working in Guangong for several years.*

As our goal was to learn about how things are made in China, we decided that we should make something. As researchers, we usually do books. Therefore, we decided to make a book in the short span of time of our investigation (10 days). One of the goal was to understand and provide a clear example of the legendary *Shenzhen speed*, in the city were products usually raise and fell in a matter of days.  

Words changing in meaning and use, places disappearing or moving, people leaving or arriving... One of the great challenge for researchers in China is the velocity of changes. To understand better the incredible pace of things here, we inflict a very ambitious time constrain by setting the goal of making a book in a few days. After 8 days of fieldwork, we spent a day selecting materials, defining a plan and compiling into a booklet. It was a late night on inDesign, as you may imagine.  

We did not aim at having a full analysis written. We know that scientific publishing takes time. Our goal was to put together a first version of a book that will continue to evolve with the following steps of this research. We still have to explore all the data and materials we collected, write proper reporting and methodological notes, and of course providing interesting and useful analysis based on these.

For this very first version, we decided to just present elements of methodology we used as an introduction. This book still to come and is in the making. Here is a first preview.

## The workshops

As part of the research process, we pay specific attention in the ways we describe our intentions and interact with the different people we met. We had the idea to organize workshop focusing on mapping and presenting results. The workshops were very successful with more than 50 people altogether during the sessions held in [Shanghai XSpace on March 3rd](/2018/02/workshop-shanghai/) and [Shenzhen Design Center on March 10th](/2018/02/release-party-shenzhen/).

### at xSpace in Shanghai

In Shanghai, we had very interesting exchanges about making with both newcomers, space owners, government representative and experts of the topic. During the day, we divided the place in several spaces for mapping, editing, drawing and writing. Each part of the space had different activities, leading to numerous discussions about the present, past and future of spaces for making in the city of Shanghai.

The evening was dedicated to presentation of the project by the organizers Clément Renaud and Monique Bolli and presentations of their work by the Swiss designer Anaïs Bloch and the Italian architect Emmanuele Protti (more details in [the announcemcent](/2018/02/workshop-shanghai/)). The day ended with food and drinks - as well as more interesting discussions about making in Shanghai.

### at the Center for Design and Architecture in Shenzhen

The topic of this workshop was *Web-to-Book Binding*. After 10 days of intense work investigating and compiling documentation, the last step to release our book was to print and bind it.

At 10am, half of our team members went to the print shop to produce the 300 color copies that will later constitute a book. Another half went to the event venue and started to acquire all materials required to bind the book: tools, cover, stamps, wire, etc. Participants started to arrive around 2pm from many different backgrounds: high-school students, scholars, architects, hardware designers, NGO members, etc. After introducing ourselves and getting to know each other a bit, we moved past presentations to start the real work: make the book!


![the books](/uploads/workshop-shenzhen/event/workshop-shenzhen - books.jpg)


Most handcraft workshop require each participant to do its own book, following a step-by-step procedure described in tutorial or by the teacher. For this one, we wanted to do something different by asking the question: how do we learn as a group? To bind the book, we had selected a Chinese traditional technic of book sewing that required several complex manipulation. Despite having instructions, few of us had ever do any book binding and we wanted everyone to get back home with its own copy of the book.

{% include slideshow.html images=page.images_shenzhen  id='workshop_shenzhen' %}

Instead of having each person to make its own booklet from zero to end, we divided the work in tasks: assembling the pages, drilling holes, cutting the cover, measuring rope, sewing the pages -- and of course a constant quality control to improve the process as we were doing it. Each task was separated on a different table, forming a small assembly line where everyone could change its post at anytime. In less than 2 hours, we made 31 books with lots of dedication, mistakes, and laughters. Some participants experimented for the first time sewing, hammering - and for all of us how to make books as a group.

The evening session was dedicated to more discussions and further presentation of the context of this research project. Michelle Poon from Hong Kong's hackerspace [Dim Sum Labs](https://www.dimsumlabs.com/) gave us an account of her book *The Field Guide To Hacking* that compiles many tutorials and texts from local makers in the Pearl River Delta. We ended the day with food and drinks prepared by [OIL](https://www.facebook.com/OilclubShenzhen/).


*The whole day was hosted graciously by the [Shenzhen Center for Urban Design and Architecture](http://www.szdesigncenter.org/?lang=en). Thank you!*


### The first version (v0) of the book

You will find here the version of the book that has been printed. The production of this first draft was an intense experience, with lots of learning that still have to be processed. During the next months, we will be building upon what we started - stay tuned!
