The ten days of intense fieldwork, visits and interviews of the MapMakers project have lead to the production of a small booklet that was finalized during the final event in Shenzhen.

## The fieldwork

During the *Mapping Spaces for Making* workshop, we wanted to re-collect how different spaces that have been instrumental in the storytelling of makers in Shanghai and Shenzhen have been transforming over the years. During 10 days, a research team of 4 to 6 people have been collecting pictures, drawings, maps, data and recordings during visits into these different spaces. The research team was made of :

- Clément Renaud, geographer and computer scientists from EPFL
- Monique Bolli, phD student in social anthropology
- Anais Bloch, product designer and researcher at HEAD Geneva
- Emanuele Protti, architect at Polytechnico Torino
- Florence Graezer-Bideau, anthropologist at EPFL
- Marc Laperouzza, economist at EPFL

We spent 5 days in each city : 4 days of investigation and 1 day dedicated to public restitution. Altogether, we visited a dozen of spaces from the smallest fablab to larger electronic retail cluster. The information we collected will be subject to publication under different forms (online blogging, scientific articles, book, etc). For now, we will take the time during the following months to process all this data.

## Making the prototype of a book

"Learning-by-doing" is one of the foundational pillar of discourses and practices in maker communities. Indeed, what better learning process than doing things yourself? Tim Ingold in his book *Making* show the importance of experiencing the gestures to understand better how things are made.

As our goal was to learn about how things are made in China, we decided that we should make something. As researchers, we usually do books. Therefore, we decided to make a book in the short span of time of our investigation (10 days). One of the goal was to understand and provide a clear example of the legendary *Shenzhen speed*, in the city were products usually raise and fell in a matter of days.  

Words changing in meaning and use, places disappearing or moving, people leaving or arriving... One of the great challenge for researchers in China is the velocity of changes. To understand better the incredible pace of things here, we inflict a very ambitious time constrain by setting the goal of making a book in a few days. After 8 days of fieldwork, we spent a day selecting materials, defining a plan and compiling into a booklet. It was a late night on inDesign, as you may imagine.  

We did not aim at having a full analysis written. We know that scientific publishing takes time. Our goal was to put together a first version of a book that will continue to evolve with the following steps of this research. We still have to explore all the data and materials we collected, write proper reporting and methodological notes, and of course providing interesting and useful analysis based on these.

This book still to come and is in the making. You can find a digital copy of the very first version here.

## The workshops

For restitutions, two workshops were held in [Shanghai XSpace on March 3rd](/2018/02/workshop-shanghai/) and [Shenzhen Design Center on March 10th](/2018/02/release-party-shenzhen/).



EVENT SHANGHAI

The workshop in Shanghai has been a collaborative workshop with very
interesting exchanges and corners for mapping, editing, drawing and
writing. The activity was followed by an introduction by the organizers
Clément Renaud and Monique Bolli as well as presentations by the Swiss
designer Anaïs Bloch and the Italian architect Emmanuele Protti.\

EVENT SHENZHEN

The WEB-TO-BOOK BINDING Workshop that took place in Shenzhen was a great
opportunity to share and learn while making a zine together. The team
had prepared the content during the 10 days and the open event at the
Design Center became a workchain of making a booklet to map spaces for
making in Shanghai and Shenzhen. The activity was followed by a
presentation by Clément Renaud of the concept of the zine and the
experience as well as the book launch by Michelle Poon of her book "The
Field Guide To Hacking".
