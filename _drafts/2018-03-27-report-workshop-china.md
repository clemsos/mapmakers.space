The ten days of intense fieldwork, visits and interviews of the MapMakers project have lead to the production of a small booklet that was finalized during the final event in Shenzhen.

In the workshop *Mapping Spaces for Making* we wanted to re-collect how
the ongoing transformations have been unfolding in the maker movement in
China. During 10 days, a team of ethnographers, makers, policy-makers,
media archeologists, designers, architects, geographers and artists have
worked together to share and gather knowledge as well as to map the
story of making in Shanghai and Shenzhen. In each city, we organized an
open and collective workshop of exchange and making with restitutions of
our research and of three architects and designer.

EVENT SHANGHAI

The workshop in Shanghai has been a collaborative workshop with very
interesting exchanges and corners for mapping, editing, drawing and
writing. The activity was followed by an introduction by the organizers
Clément Renaud and Monique Bolli as well as presentations by the Swiss
designer Anaïs Bloch and the Italian architect Emmanuele Protti.\

EVENT SHENZHEN

The WEB-TO-BOOK BINDING Workshop that took place in Shenzhen was a great
opportunity to share and learn while making a zine together. The team
had prepared the content during the 10 days and the open event at the
Design Center became a workchain of making a booklet to map spaces for
making in Shanghai and Shenzhen. The activity was followed by a
presentation by Clément Renaud of the concept of the zine and the
experience as well as the book launch by Michelle Poon of her book "The
Field Guide To Hacking".
